# Hello there this is my blog

First blog entry trying to figure out how to get all of this setup. I needed to install hugo which was really easy
using ```sudo apt install hugo```. I then followed the quickstart guide on hugos site [quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).
After creating the base folder for the blog you should look for some themes. I added a theme by cloning that bad boy into my themes folder. Then I just followed the README that
was in that theme repo. I added this post to content/posts/first.md. I think whats next is for me to figure out how google cloud works because I plan on hosting my blog there.
